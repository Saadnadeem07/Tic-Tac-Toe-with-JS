# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game repository! This is a simple and interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where you can play as a player against another player (Player vs Player). The game is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Player vs Player Mode**: Play Tic Tac Toe 3x3 grid layout with a friend.
- **Interactive UI**: Modern design with hover effects and smooth animations.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.
- **Game Reset**: A button to restart the game and track the winner.
- **Scoreboard (Optional)**: Display the score of the ongoing game.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, player interaction, and state management.

## How to Play

2. The game alternates between "X" and "O". The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
3. After the game ends, click the **Restart Game** button to play again.
